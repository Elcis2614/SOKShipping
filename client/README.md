     # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

✅ Key improvements:

1. Switched from cookie-based to token-based auth:

     - Removed cookie handling
     - Token stored in sessionStorage
     - Token passed in Authorization header
     - Simpler CORS configuration
2. Authorization header handling: 
     const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];
3. Token storage in sessionStorage:
     sessionStorage.setItem('token', JSON.stringify(response.data.token));
4. Token retrieval and auth check:
     const token = JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem('token'));
     if (token) {
         // Use token in headers
     }
    
Some immediate priorities might be:

Reviews and ratings system ✅
Wishlist functionality
Advanced search and filtering ✅
Email notifications
More payment method
